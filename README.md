# Aim
This is an Azure Function (AF) using python. This AF is time triggered every minute to an API which retrieves the relevant financial information. 

# What did I learn?
I learned about Azure Functions and I learned how to implement an API into a programme. I also learned the relevant coding skills necessary for the AF to run.
